Terms and Facts of XEphem Source Code Download
==============================================

1. Permission to build and  run XEphem from this source code  is granted only 
for personal use or for bona fide  educational  situations or research funded
by public funds. Permission is expressly  prohibited in commercial or milita-
ry situations without prior agreement.

2. XEphem source  code  may not  be used, in whole or in part, to build other
computer programs under any circumstances without prior agreement.

3. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE ABOUT THE  SUITABILITY OF THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANY
PURPOSE. IT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY.

4. Redistribution rights: You may redistribute XEphem source code only in its
entirety and without modification. You may redistribute binaries only if they
were built from the original source code, or from source code with very minor
changes made for the purpose of porting  and not for the purposes of changing
functionality.

5. What you are about  to download is not  an executable  program or even the
complete XEphem support system.  It  is  a UNIX tar.gz  file containing the C 
source code and two  sample data catalogs only,  Messier and  YBS.  The other 
catalogs, gallery collection,  Lunar imagery and the prebuilt executables are
in the commercial  edition only.  To build a running program you need ANSI C,
X11 and Motif development libraries, a POSIX  operating system and the skills
to build such programs.
